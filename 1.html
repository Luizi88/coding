When I find myself in times of trouble. Mother Mary comes to me. Speaking words of wisdom. Let it be. And in my hours of darkness. She is standing bright in front of me. Speaking words of wisdom. Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. Whisper words of wisdom. Let it be. When the broken hearted people. Living in the world agree. There will be an answer. Let it be. Though they may be parted. There is still a chance that they will see.<img src="cutting board.jpeg" width="100%"></p><p style="margin-top:45px;">There will be an answer. Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. There will be an answer. Let it be.When the night is cloudy. There is still a light that shines on me. Shine until tomorrow. Let it be. I wake up to the sound of music. Mother Mary comes to me. Speaking words of wisdom. Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. Whisper words of wisdom. Let it be.</p>
